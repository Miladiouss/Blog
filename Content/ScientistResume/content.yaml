        title: Researcher at University of California, Irvine
        date: 2015-2019
        bullets:
            - Deep Learning Image Classification on Astronomical Data with 50 Training Examples
            - Designed, tested, and published a new deep CNN architecture with PyTorch for biased and limited datasets (less than 50 examples) to identify rare astronomical events known as gravitational lenses among millions of common galaxy images.
            - 'Ph.D. Thesis: <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/119576c5" target="_blank">Deep Mining and its Astronomical Applications</a>'
            - Mentored graduate and undergraduate students for various projects with leveraged interpersonal and communication skills and by advocating critical and independent thinking.
    uci_gan:
        title: Using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to Synthesize Gravitational Lenses
        date: 2018
        bullets:
            - Used for boosting the training examples for image classification.
            - A generator was constructed from a series of transposed convolutions to upsample a latent vector to an RGB image.
            - A discriminator was used to identify synthesised images from real images.
            - A loss function was assigned to be maximized by the generator and minimized by the discriminator.
            - The discriminator was re-trained on synthesised data from 20 differently initialized GANs and used for data mining.
